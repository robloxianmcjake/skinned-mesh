it is important that I advise you NOT to use the texture in the file for roblox, this could get your account deleted.

STEP 1. open up roblox studio and go to the plugins tab. once you are there, you will see a button (if you scroll to the side),
that says "Avatar Importer" and click it. once you are their, click "Custom" with the egg icon and locate the .fbx file on this folder.
when you have located the .fbx file, click it and press "open".

STEP 2.
go to https://www.roblox.com/library/5984399911/tsg-finaldiff-test and use that texture to apply to the mesh.
after you have done that scale the character to a size that a roblox character would be.




enjoy
